    <p>Since childhood I have heard my mother say that your knowledge is useless if you cannot share it with people around you. I have always agreed with the fact that knowledge is to share and not to hide. When I was young I got into engineering and started working in TCS. But soon after, I realised my real passion lies in teaching. 
      <br>
      <br>At this time it was difficult to find a teaching job. Then I learned about WhitehatJr. This platform was a light source in my life. It gave me all what I passionate about. I am able to pursue my hobby and a dream because of it. </p>
